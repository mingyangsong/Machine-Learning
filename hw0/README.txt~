To test and get k for best result I took three steps:
1)Write an exp.py file where making a for loop for k from 2 to 500(because k<2 doesn't make sense)
2)Print all the k and the accuracy result
3)Sort the result according to accuracy and get all the results

Following is part of the sorted results which shows the largest 19 situations.
[0.52380952381000001, 'K=', '479\n']
[0.52587991718399996, 'K=', '17\n']
[0.52681388012599994, 'K=', '183\n']
[0.52811244979899996, 'K=', '2\n']
[0.52860411899299997, 'K=', '63\n']
[0.52867830423899997, 'K=', '99\n']
[0.52941176470600004, 'K=', '466\n']
[0.52978056426300002, 'K=', '181\n']
[0.53333333333300004, 'K=', '470\n']
[0.54545454545500005, 'K=', '467\n']
[0.54838709677399999, 'K=', '469\n']
[0.5625, 'K=', '468\n']
[0.57142857142900005, 'K=', '493\n']
[0.66666666666700003, 'K=', '494\n']
[0.80000000000000004, 'K=', '495\n']
[1.0, 'K=', '496\n']
[1.0, 'K=', '497\n']
[1.0, 'K=', '498\n']
[1.0, 'K=', '499\n']

From above, we need to pick a reasonable situation which means if you pic "K=499" you have only one predictor based on the data file, which does not make any sense. 
We need to consider 1)number of predictors is not too small 2)K is not too large which means you do not have to pick so many days for prediction.
Therefore, I pick 2, 17, 63, 99, 181 firstly. Amoung these 5 situations, I choose 99 which make the accuracy large enough and sample number large enough, also you do not need too many days(like >100) to predict.
